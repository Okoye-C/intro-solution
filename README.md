Solution to frontend project; Intro section with dropdown navigation. By frontend mentors

Good Day dear reader
Thank you for looking at my source code, I don't have much to say seeing as this is a relatively easy design. I explained everything in my javascript code I thought might be confusing for new developers.

I used HTML, SCSS and plain Javascript to develop this website and I made it as understandable as I could.
I hope this helps in every possible way. Thank you
